# random-password-generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a personalized password generator for anyone who may be interested in conveniently generating a strong password with a high degree of security. This password generator is personalized in that it prompts the user to accept or decline certain criteria for which character types they wish to include, as well as enabling the user to specify the desired amount of characters used. A password will be randomly generated based on the chosen criteria within moments of filling out the prompts.
